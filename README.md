# General objectives
* Patches to all components are tracked in the repository
* Patches can be re-applied after updates
* On updates patches should be rebased to easily re-upstream them

# Research topics
* Rebasing subtrees?
* Checkout a tag and have detached head?
* Slim subtree with only relevant commits to reduce repo weight? This will give for every use case a different solution.

# Comparison to submodules
* (+) Has more drive, better toolbase and less clutter
* (+) Everything in repo, so does not rely on network connection
* (-) Not supported yet by drush and git_deploy.module
* (-) Large repository weight

# Slim subtree use cases

## Make component a subtree
* Subtree add foo-patched (checked out)
* Add branch foo-upstream = foo-patched
* (none of tha foo patches has a origin yet)

## Update component
* In workspace fork
* checkout foo-upstream
* dl foo & commit
* checkout foo-patched
* rebase

## Push patches
* Add foo fork repo branch mysite-patches as remote of foo-patched
* push
* cherry-pick them

# Complete subtree use cases - TODO
## Get new component as subtree
## Make existing unpatched component a subtree
## Make existing patched component a subtree
## Add or swap remote repository
